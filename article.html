    <h1>Measuring AI Agent Adoption in R&D Organizations: A Data-Driven Approach</h1>
    
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 30px;">
        This article describes Git Detective, an open-source tool for measuring AI adoption in development teams. Source code: <a href="https://github.com/orico/git-detective" target="_blank">github.com/orico/git-detective</a>
    </p>

    <h2>The Challenge for Technical Leaders</h2>
    <p>
        As a technical leader in an R&D organization, you're likely facing a critical challenge in today's rapidly evolving
        development landscape: How do you effectively measure and track the adoption of AI coding agents within your
        organization? With tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude, and GPT becoming increasingly prevalent in development
        workflows, understanding their impact and adoption rate is crucial for making informed decisions about your
        organization's technical strategy.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>The Need for Measurement</h2>
        <p>
            Consider this scenario: You're a VP of R&D or a technical director who has invested in AI coding tools for your
            team. You believe in the potential of these tools to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accelerate development velocity</li>
            <li>Reduce time spent on boilerplate code</li>
            <li>Enable developers to focus on higher-value tasks</li>
            <li>Maintain consistency across the codebase</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            But how do you know if your team is actually leveraging these tools? How do you measure the return on
            investment? This is where data-driven insights become invaluable.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>The AI Contribution Pattern Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>
        One of the key observations in AI-assisted development is the pattern of code contributions. AI agents tend to
        generate larger, more comprehensive code blocks in a single iteration, while human developers typically make
        smaller, more incremental changes. This creates a distinctive pattern that can be analyzed:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI-Generated Commits:</strong> Typically larger, containing complete implementations or significant
            refactoring</li>
        <li><strong>Manual Commits:</strong> Usually smaller, focused on specific fixes, tweaks, or incremental
            improvements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Introducing Git Detective: A Tool for Measuring AI Adoption</h2>
    <p>
        Git Detective is a specialized tool designed to help technical leaders monitor and measure AI agent adoption
        within their organizations. It works by analyzing repository commit patterns and providing insights into how
        code is being written and committed.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            The tool performs sophisticated analysis by:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Analyzing commit sizes and patterns across repositories</li>
            <li>Identifying statistical outliers in commit sizes</li>
            <li>Using interquartile range (IQR) analysis to classify contributions</li>
            <li>Generating reports that show the proportion of likely AI-generated code</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Technical Leaders</h2>
    <p>
        With Git Detective, technical leaders can track several important metrics:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Adoption Rate:</strong> Percentage of commits classified as likely AI-generated</li>
        <li><strong>Adoption Trends:</strong> Growth in AI-assisted development over time</li>
        <li><strong>Team Utilization:</strong> Which teams are leveraging AI tools most effectively</li>
        <li><strong>Impact Analysis:</strong> Correlation between AI usage and development velocity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
    <p>
        The code for Git Detective is available in this repository: <a href="https://github.com/orico/git-detective" target="_blank">https://github.com/orico/git-detective</a>. You can run it easily with a single command:

    <h2>Example Output</h2>
    <p>
        Here's an actual output from analyzing a repository, showing how the tool classifies different commits:
    </p>
    <pre><code>+------------+---------------------------+-----------------+------------+---------------+---------------------+
| Commit     | Date                      |   Lines Changed | % Change   |   Total Lines | Contribution Type   |
+============+===========================+=================+============+===============+=====================+
| 3eb8a37d0e | 2025-03-29 06:03:08 +0300 |            1515 | N/A        |          1515 | Likely AI           |
| d19be46e0d | 2025-03-29 06:05:08 +0300 |              16 | 1.06%      |          1515 | Likely Human        |
| 53eb35e125 | 2025-03-29 07:29:38 +0300 |             176 | 11.62%     |          1547 | Possible AI         |

    <p>
        The tool also provides detailed statistical analysis of the repository:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
Changes per commit (mean)        422.44
Changes per commit (median)      93.50
Changes standard deviation       750.84
Percentage change (mean)         16.27%
Percentage change (std)          29.94%
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Understanding the Results</h2>
    <p>
        Let's analyze what these numbers tell us about AI adoption in this repository:
    </p>

    <h3>Commit Size Patterns</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Large AI Commits:</strong> Several commits show significant changes (1515, 1104, 1125, and 2812 lines), 
            all classified as "Likely AI". These large commits typically represent complete feature implementations or major refactoring.</li>
        <li><strong>Human-Scale Changes:</strong> Most commits labeled as "Likely Human" range from 16 to 127 lines, 
            showing the typical incremental development pattern of human developers.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Distinction:</strong> The size difference between AI and human commits is substantial - AI commits 
            are often 10-20 times larger than typical human commits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Statistical Insights</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Size Distribution:</strong> The large gap between mean (422.44) and median (93.50) lines per commit 
            indicates that while most changes are relatively small, the occasional very large (AI) commits significantly 
            impact the average.</li>
        <li><strong>Normal Human Range:</strong> The commit data suggests that typical human commits modify between 1-5% of the codebase, 
            with most changes being incremental improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Impact:</strong> The high standard deviation (750.84 lines) reflects the bi-modal nature of the 
            changes - smaller human commits mixed with much larger AI-generated contributions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Adoption Pattern:</strong> The repository shows a healthy mix of AI and human contributions, with AI 
            being used primarily for larger, more complex changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Workflow Integration:</strong> The pattern suggests developers are effectively using AI for major 
            implementations while maintaining human oversight through smaller refinements and adjustments.</li>
        <li><strong>Development Velocity:</strong> Large AI commits (>1000 lines) are followed by series of smaller human 
            commits (16-127 lines), indicating a pattern of AI-assisted rapid development followed by human refinement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Making Data-Driven Decisions</h2>
    <p>
        With these insights, technical leaders can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify teams that might need additional training or support with AI tools</li>
        <li>Measure the effectiveness of AI tool adoption initiatives</li>
        <li>Make informed decisions about investing in AI development tools</li>
        <li>Track the ROI of AI coding assistant subscriptions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        As organizations continue to adopt AI coding agents, having concrete metrics to measure their impact becomes
        increasingly important. Git Detective provides technical leaders with the insights they need to understand how
        their teams are leveraging AI tools and make data-driven decisions about their development processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        By monitoring these KPIs, leaders can ensure their organizations are effectively utilizing AI agents while
        maintaining code quality and development best practices. This data-driven approach to measuring AI adoption
        helps organizations optimize their development processes and maximize the return on their investment in AI
        tools.
